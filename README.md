# Deep learning algorithms:

This repo comprises of several Deep learning algorithns from basic to more advanceed algorithms.
These algorithms include and are not limited to following:

* Intro to Tensorflow and Keras
* Basic tensorflow CNNs and more advanced like Resnets
* Keras CNN applications such as Horse/human classifier, sad/happy detector
* Advanced CNNs applications like Neural style transfer, facial recognition, and object detection with yolo
* Recurrent neural networks and LSTM for Character level language models. music note generator, Word analogies
* Sequential Modela for machine translation and word triggers

These mainly come from my cousera courses and experiences in depp learning and I hope to develop the code base further and more with time
